# ClojureScript Pong

[![Project Status: Concept â€“ Minimal or no implementation has been done yet, or the repository is only intended to be a limited example, demo, or proof-of-concept.](http://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/concept.svg)](http://www.repostatus.org/#concept)

This is a version of Pong built in ClojureScript using the Canvas APIs. It is
based on the JavaScript Pong example posted on the [thoughtbot
blog](http://robots.thoughtbot.com/pong-clone-in-javascript) in August, 2013.


## Why?

ClojureScript, as a hosted language that compiles down to JavaScript, is
flexible enough that it *is* possible to directly port most JavaScript code to
ClojureScript. However, the true strength of ClojureScript only really becomes
apparent when you leave behind JavaScript conventions and begin using
ClojureScript as it was intended...
